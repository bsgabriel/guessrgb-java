# guessrgb-java

It's the same thing of the other game, but made in Java.


# To-do list:
 - Add an option to play again
 - Add an score counter
 - Allow difficulty change (easy = 3 squares, hard = 6 squares)
 - Add a smooth fade out when the square disappears (when the player click on the wrong color)
