# guessrgb-java

It's the same thing as the web game, but made in Java.
Play the web version here: https://rgb-bsg.netlify.app


# To-do list:
 - Add an option to play again {C}
 - Add an score counter {C}
 - Allow difficulty change (easy = 3 squares, hard = 6 squares) {C}
 - Refactoring (for better code legibity and maybe performance)
 - Add a smooth fade out when the square disappears (when the player click on the wrong color)
